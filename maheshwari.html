            <p><strong>Intro & History:</strong> Maheshwari sarees originate from Maheshwar, a small town on the banks of the Narmada River in Madhya Pradesh. The craft was revived in the 18th century by Queen Ahilyabai Holkar of the Holkar dynasty, who invited weavers from Gujarat and Malwa to settle in Maheshwar and teach their skills to local artisans, creating a unique fusion style that has endured for over 250 years.</p>

            <p><strong>Significance & Work:</strong> Woven on handlooms using a fine blend of cotton and silk, Maheshwari sarees are known for their lightweight feel, reversible borders, and distinctive temple, check, or geometric motifs inspired by the fort architecture of Maheshwar. The pallu and border often feature zari work with intricate patterns like Rui Phul (cotton flower) and Leheriya (wave). The saree is elegant, breathable, and versatile — suitable for daily wear, office, or semi-formal occasions. It represents Madhya Pradesh's royal patronage of crafts, women's empowerment through weaving cooperatives, and a perfect balance of tradition and understated sophistication.</p>
