            <p><strong>Intro & History:</strong> Paithani sarees originate from Paithan near Aurangabad, Maharashtra, with roots tracing back over 2,000 years to the Satavahana dynasty. They were historically patronized by royalty and mentioned in ancient texts. The craft nearly faded but was revived in the 20th century through government and artisan initiatives, preserving its legacy as one of India's most opulent weaves.</p>

            <p><strong>Significance & Work:</strong> Traditional Paithani uses tapestry technique with interlocking threads (no floats on reverse), pure silk, and real zari to create rich peacock, lotus, and floral motifs with gold borders. "Inspired" versions adapt these motifs on lighter bases while retaining the grandeur. The saree is heavy with symbolism — peacock for beauty and prosperity, lotus for purity — and is a bridal favorite, worn for weddings, festivals, and auspicious occasions. It embodies Maharashtra's royal heritage, intricate craftsmanship, and enduring cultural pride — a true heirloom piece of unmatched splendor.</p>
