            <p><strong>Intro & History:</strong> Lambani (also known as Banjara or Gor) embroidery originates from the Lambani tribal communities of Karnataka, Telangana, and Maharashtra. The craft dates back to the 16th century when these nomadic groups migrated across India, using embroidery to adorn their clothing, tents, and belongings as a form of portable art and cultural expression.</p>

            <p><strong>Significance & Work:</strong> Lambani work is characterized by bold geometric patterns, mirror work (abhla), cowrie shells, beads, and vibrant thread colors stitched onto cotton or silk bases. Techniques include appliqué, patchwork, and dense chain stitch. The motifs often represent nature, fertility, protection, and tribal folklore. Each piece is entirely hand-stitched by women artisans, making it a powerful symbol of tribal identity, resilience, and community bonding. Lambani sarees are festive, joyful, and eye-catching — perfect for cultural events, bohemian styling, or as statement pieces that honor India's nomadic heritage.</p>
