            <p><strong>Intro & History:</strong> Cotton-silk bullion embroidery combines the softness of cotton-silk blends with the textured, three-dimensional bullion stitch technique, which has roots in 19th-century European and Indian embroidery traditions. It gained popularity in modern Indian couture for its ability to add rich, sculptural detail to lightweight fabrics while maintaining comfort and breathability.</p>

            <p><strong>Significance & Work:</strong> The base fabric is a fine cotton-silk blend, offering the best of both worlds: cotton's breathability and silk's subtle sheen. Bullion knots — tightly coiled thread stitches — are hand-embroidered to create raised floral, paisley, or abstract motifs, often accented with beads, sequins, or zari. The result is a textured, luxurious saree with depth and dimension that catches light beautifully. Versatile for semi-formal events, parties, or contemporary ethnic wear, it represents modern fusion craftsmanship — blending comfort, artistry, and elegance for the discerning woman who values both tradition and innovation.</p>
