            <p><strong>Intro & History:</strong> Tissue silk (also called tissue or zari tissue) is a luxurious weave with roots in the Mughal era, when Persian and Central Asian influences brought metallic-thread weaving to India. Varanasi and other North Indian centers perfected the technique, blending fine silk with gold or silver zari to create shimmering fabrics that were once reserved for royalty and nobility.</p>

            <p><strong>Significance & Work:</strong> Tissue silk is made by weaving pure silk warp with gold/silver zari weft, resulting in a luminous, lightweight fabric with a rich metallic sheen. It often features delicate butis (small floral motifs), zari borders, or full-field patterns. The saree drapes beautifully, catching light with every movement, and feels airy despite the metallic threads. It symbolizes opulence, celebration, and timeless grandeur — ideal for weddings, receptions, Diwali, and festive evenings. Tissue silk is a celebration of India's zari craftsmanship and Mughal-era elegance reborn for modern celebrations.</p>
