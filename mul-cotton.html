            <p><strong>Intro & History:</strong> Mul cotton (also known as mulmul or muslin) has ancient origins in Bengal, with references dating back to the 4th century BC. It reached legendary status during the Mughal era when Dhaka muslin was described as "woven air" — so fine it could pass through a ring. The craft suffered greatly under British colonial policies but has seen a revival in recent decades through dedicated artisan cooperatives.</p>

            <p><strong>Significance & Work:</strong> Mul cotton is spun and woven into an ultra-fine, feather-light fabric from high-quality cotton. It is prized for its exceptional softness, breathability, and drape. Often hand-embroidered with delicate motifs or left plain for its natural texture, mul cotton sarees are cool in summer and elegant year-round. They represent Bengal's textile mastery, resilience against historical suppression, and a return to sustainable, heritage weaving. Perfect for daily wear, summer weddings, or as a comfortable yet sophisticated choice that honors centuries of craftsmanship.</p>
