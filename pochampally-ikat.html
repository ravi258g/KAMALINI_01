            <p><strong>Intro & History:</strong> Pochampally Ikat sarees hail from Bhoodan Pochampally in Telangana, a region renowned for its centuries-old tie-and-dye weaving tradition. The craft was revived in the 1970s after receiving GI (Geographical Indication) protection, drawing inspiration from ancient Ikat techniques seen in Gujarat's Patola and Odisha's Bomkai.</p>

            <p><strong>Significance & Work:</strong> Each saree is created using the resist-dyeing method — threads are meticulously tied and dyed before being woven on handlooms, resulting in crisp geometric patterns and vibrant symmetry. The technique ensures the design appears on both sides of the fabric, making it reversible and exceptionally durable. Pochampally Ikat symbolizes South Indian textile heritage, blending bold modernity with deep-rooted tradition — perfect for festive occasions, temple visits, or elegant everyday wear.</p>
